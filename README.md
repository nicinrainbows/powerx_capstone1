# Power X Traineeship: Capstone Project #1

This project aims to establish statistical analysis using historical US macro data and financial instruments, whilst utilizing concepts from the Data Structures and Algorithm courses.

## Dataset (30-year historical):
Macro-related: US CPI, Inflation, Money Supply
Financial Instruments: SPY (S&P500), GLD (GOLD), USO (OIL)

## Knowledge / Skill applied:
Data structures: Array, 2-dimensional dataframe, dynamic lists, max heap
Algorithm(s) / Concepts(s): Recursion, dynamic programming


## Getting started
Create virtual environment from environment file:
- for anaconda:
`conda env create -f capstone1_env.yml`
- for pip:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nicinrainbows/powerx_capstone1.git
$ cd [PATH TO REPO DIRECTORY] # Enter to project directory
$ python -m venv capstone1_venv # If not created, creating virtualenv
$ source ./capstone1_venv/bin/activate # Activating virtualenv
(capstone1_venv)$ pip install -r ./requirements.txt # Installing dependencies
```
